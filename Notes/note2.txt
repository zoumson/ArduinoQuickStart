Arduino 2: Interfacing with Hardware 


A. Interface with an LCD
1. Introduction to the liquid crystal display (LCD)
a. The principle behind the LCD is to energize a series
of crystals to appear either opaque or transparent against
a lighted background 
b. 16 by 2 LCD
- 2 rows
- 16 columns
c. Alphanumeric LCD 
d. Graphical LCD 
- The graphical LCD devices use a single larger grid of 
individual lights to display information, instead of 
a separate grid for each character.
- Ability to display any character in any resolution

2. Understanding HD4470 controller
a. Used to manage LCD
b. Dot matrix
c. Each dot has a dimension of 5 columns and 8 rows 
3. The LCD interface
4. Wire up the LCD

- Pin1: GND/VSS ground 
- Pin2: VDD source(Power Supply Pin, +5V)
- Pin3: V0 (Display Contrast)
Adjust brightness 
Adjusting power supply voltage for LCD 
- PIN4: RS (Register Select) 
Memory: 
LOW(0) ==> Send Command
HIGH(1) ==> Send Data
- Pin5: RW (Read/Write) 
LOW(0) ==> Write, can be connected to GND
HIGH(1) ==> Read 
- Pin6: E/EN(Enable) 
Operation enable signal for read and write
- Pin7-14: D0 - D7 (8 Digital Pins) 
The states of these pins: HIGH or LOW
- Pin15: BLA/A (Anode) 
LED Backlight
Connected to 5V
- Pin16: BLK/A (Cathode) 
LED Backlight
Connected to GND

- Potentiomenter connect to Pin3 

5. Coding the LCD interface
6. Optional review: Understanding "for" loops
7. Optional review: Understanding arrays
8. Displaying random numbers and scrolling 


B. Interface with a 7-Segment LED 
1. Overview of the 7-Segment LED
2. The 7-Segment LED component 
3. 7-Segment LED display types
a. Common Anode
- Common Voltage Source 
- The individual LEDs are illuminated by connecting the 
individual cathode terminals to LOW 
b. Common Cathode
- Common ground  
- The individual LEDs are illuminated by connecting the 
individual cathode terminals to HIGH 

4. Checking a 7-Segment LED
5. Wiring up the 7-Segment LED
6. Cycle through each LED directly 
7. Cycle through LEDs with a for loop 
8. Understanding the 7-Segment LED truth table
9. Coding 7-Segment display showing numbers

C. Interface with a 7-Segment LED Using a Shift Register
1. Understanding the shift register 
a. 4-Bit Shift Register
b. Serial in  
c. Parallel out  
e. 4 clock cycle 

2. MC74HC595A shift register overview 
3. Wire up the input and clock signals
4. Wire up the signals for VCC and GND 
5. Wire up the  7-Segment LED
6. Initializing pins for the shift register
7. The shiftOut command

D. Interface with a Keypad
1. Introduction to the keypad interface 
2. Wiring up the keypad 
3. Optional review: IF statement 
4. Optional review: The switch... case statement
5. Understanding two-dimentional arrays
6. Setup the keypad library 
7. HelloKeypad
8. Using the keypad with LEDs 
9. Combine the keypad and 7-segment LED  
10. Combine them all: LCD + keypad + LED
