Arduino 1: The foundations


A. Introduction to Arduino
1. What is and Arduino
2. The Arduino layout
3. Digital interfaces
4. Analog interfaces
5. The power pins

B. Creating an Arduino Program
1. Download the Arduino software
2. A tour of the Arduino IDE
3. The setup() and loop() functions
4. pinMode()
5. digitalWrite()
6. Creating your first sketch
7. Serial Monitor
8. Testing blink LED and Serial Monitor

C. Interface with Output(LED)
1. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs)
a. Diode
- Electrical component that only allows a current to flow in one direction
- Anode: positive side, lead is longer
- Cathode: negative side, lead is shorter 
b. Current Limiting Resistor 
- Used in a circuit to ensure that maximum current is not exceeded
- Higher resistor values will further lower the current, reducing the brightness of the LED
- Ohm's Law = V = I X R ==> R = V/I
- Check Datasheet
- Forward current: 
•	Red LED value = 20 mA, 10 mA for safety
•	Green LED value = 20 mA, 10 mA for safety
•	Blue LED value = 20 mA, 10 mA for safety

- Forward voltage
•	Red LED value = 1.8 V
•	Green LED value = 3 V
•	Blue LED value = 3 V

2. Deep dive: Calculating a current limiting resistor
Example:
•	Red LED, digitalWrite, mode OUTPUT, set value to HIGH
•	Pin 2 produces 5V max
•	Red LED voltage drop is 1.8 V
•	LED current is 10 mA
•	Desired resistor = (5V - 1.8V)/10mA = 320 Ohm, closest available is 330 Ohm

3. Wire an LED to Arduino
4. Code to blink an LED
5. Example: Wiring a digital traffic signal
6. Example: Coding a digital traffic signal 

D. Interface with Input(Pushbutton)
1. Pushbutton
a. Electrical component that connects two points in a circuit when pressed
b. Momentary Pushbutton
c. Maintained Pushbutton
d. Normally Open
e. Normally Closed

2. Active low, active high
a. Active low/Pull up circuit
When the switch or button is activated, it sends a low signal.
- 5V to resistor
- resistor to Pushbutton
- Pushbutton to ground
- pin 10 mode is INPUT

b. Active High/Pull down circuit
when the switch or button is activated, it sends a high signal.
- 5V to pushbutton
- Pushbutton to resistor
- Resistor to ground
- pin 10 mode is INPUT

3. Wire a pushbutton to Arduino
4. Code for the pushbutton
5. Activate an LED with pushbutton
6. Using the built-in LED with INPUT_PULLUP
